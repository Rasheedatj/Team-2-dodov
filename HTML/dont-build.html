                <div class="third-text">
                    <p>In 2019, I wanted to create a website that closely followed our custom design
                        and had smooth animations and interactions. I looked at 
                        <a href="https://getuikit.com/docs/introduction" class="out-link">UIkit</a>, 
                        but I didn't pick it for two reasons:</p>
                    <p>
                        It had its own opinion on design
                    It didn't meet my requirements for "smoothness"
                    </p>
                    <p>This lead me to search for other frameworks that, unlike UIkit, 
                        provide just the basic JavaScript functionality, allowing you to style and animate as 
                        you wish. I didn't find anything. So, naturally, I decided to make <a href="https://github.com/OblikStudio/toolkit" class="out-link">
                            my own thing</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>I was developing the framework in parallel with the website I was working on and it was
                         wonderful. I was able to make the code just right and implement just the features I
                          need. I took some inspiration from UIkit, but stuck to my main idea.
                        </p>
                    <p>Later, I noticed that things weren't very efficient, so I decided to refactor.
                         But because I was developing that framework and simultaneously using it, I
                          had to rework not only the framework, but the website as well. Apart from
                           that, I was trying to make this work for as many use cases as I could. 
                           What if you use React? What if you don't? What if you use jQuery? What if
                            you don't even know JavaScript that much?
                        </p>
                    <p>At this point, my enthusiasm slowly started to fade away. Without realizing 
                        it, I had put myself in a position where I wanted to solve problems that 
                        don't yet exist and solve them perfectly. But I still believed that in the 
                        end, it'd be "worth it".</p>
                    <p>Then, our team started to grow. I was no longer the only one working on that
                             website. Since it used my framework, I had to onboard new people with it. 
                             This meant that I had to write up a README, then documentation, example 
                             usage, etc. Despite that, we still had to clear up some stuff in Slack.
                            </p>
                        <p>Because our team grew, so did our workload. This caused work on the 
                            framework in parallel with the website to transition in work on the 
                            framework during the weekends and early mornings.</p>
                        <p>I carried on, though. I had (and to this point, still have) the habit of 
                            abandoning projects, so I was determined to at least boil the framework 
                            down to small organized JavaScript snippets that you could download via 
                            npm. But do I use 
                            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements" class="out-link">Custom Elements</a> or even go simpler than that and use 
                            just ES6 classes?</p> 
                        <p>Recently, I started getting more and more into the React ecosystem. Late 
                            to the party, I know. I also started noticing more websites with <span class="code-span"></span> or <span>__nuxt</span> or <span>___gatsby</span>. So no matter how I build my framework, it wouldn't work
                              with the way most people build for the web. Since I want to start using these 
                              tools as well, my framework won't work for me either.</p>
                        <p>
                            Unrelated to this, I had slowly started to pay more attention to my 
                            health and well-being. I changed my eating and sleeping habits, started 
                            to exercise and stretch more, I even started reading books… This made the
                             weekends and early mornings much more packed and valuable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And now I'm here. I had made something that nobody really uses, but still
                             represents a solid part of our workflow. What do I do? Well, I think 
                             I've learned some lessons in the past 3 years.
                        </p>  
                        <h3>Code Doesn't Matter</h3>
                        <p>
                            Unless you're building software for aircraft or medical equipment, nobody
                             really cares about your code, and neither should you. Especially in web
                              development. At the end of the day, you want a bunch of boxes with text
                               and images in them. You can have a hellish codebase and still get the 
                               job done. A perfect codebase doesn't exist. At least not for a very 
                               long time, in large projects, or with many people involved. Things 
                               will get messy and you should be ready to accept that.

                        <h3>Maintenance Is a Burden</h3>
                        <p>
                            Let's say you've built something and it works perfectly. That won't last long. Bugs will
                             appear, new people will join and documentation will be needed, features will be requested.
                              Who's going to handle that? If you're doing this as a side project, are you prepared to be
                               distracted by these things while working? If not, are you prepared to do them in your 
                               free time?
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Even if people start contributing with pull requests and taking some of 
                            that load off of you, you'll still have to review and approve of what's 
                            going on.
                        </p> 
                        <h3>Third-Party Is Fine</h3> 
                        <p>If you find someone else who has done the work for you, use it. There might 
                            be things that you don't like, but compared to the hidden costs of
                             maintaining something yourself, they won't matter. If that third-party code
                              has been out for a long time, chances are that most common bugs and edge 
                              cases would have already been handled. Doing things yourself should be 
                              your last resort, because you'll slowly discover the same issues as well
                               and waste time on solved problems.

                        <h3>Launch Early</h3> 
                        <p>
                            On the off-chance that you really want or have to build something, launch it as 
                            soon as you can. As David Heinemeier Hansson said on episode <a class="out-link" href="https://www.rework.fm/launch-now/">"Launch Now" 
                                of the Rework podcast</a>:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I never really launched my side project. It wasn't "ready". At the same time, it
                             became a bigger and bigger dependency in our main projects. That's an issue,
                              because you're building on top of something that isn't validated by other 
                              people. If I had shared it, maybe people would have helped out and given ideas
                               for improvements. Or, maybe people would have critiqued it and made me 
                               question whether it's valuable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And that's what I was most afraid of — that the project isn't valuable. 
                            But no matter how much effort you put into something, you still can't 
                            know for sure if it's valuable until other people give their own points 
                            of view. That's why it's better to launch as soon as possible:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you've built something valuable, you'll get more like-minded 
                            people to help you out with it
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you've built something pointless, you'll save time and probably learn
                             about new and better approaches
                        </p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>
                            I will archive my project. These problems have already been solved by 
                            many people, many times. We all know that every day, a new JavaScript 
                            framework is born. This happens because people like me think they've got
                             the silver bullet and can solve a certain problem once and for all. But
                              that's impossible and delusional. It's like that xkcd comic about 
                              standards:
                        </p>
                        <img src="../IMG/standards.png" alt="">
                        <p>
                            We should work on solving new problems, not existing ones. If you find an issue with someone else's code, report it or directly
                             submit a pull request and fix it. Not just for yourself, but for everybody else! Your 
                             contributions will be nicely welcomed! Don't create something new with its own set of problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's impossible to build something entirely by yourself. At some point, your 
                            "pristine" code will have to interact with other people's "messy" code. Sure,
                             you might not use third-party code on your website, but its existence still 
                             depends on it. The operating system it runs on is not built by you. The browser
                              that your viewers use to see it is not built by you. The protocols that carry
                               your data across the wire are not designed by you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You will always depend on other people's work. Embrace that!
