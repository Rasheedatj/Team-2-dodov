                <p>My favorite number is 24, and today, on the 24th of December, I turn 24. 
                    Even though it's the dawn of Web 3.0, I decided to celebrate by giving 
                    myself the miracle of Web 1.0 — a blog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that we have my favorite number cleared up, I can tell you a little bit 
                    more about myself. My name's Hristiyan and I'm a software engineer at 
                    <a href="https://oblik.studio/" class="out-link">Oblik Studio</a>
                    . I've studied computer science at <a href="https://www.elsys-bg.org/" class="out-link">ELSYS</a> and have been messing with 
                    web development since 11, thanks to my dear childhood friends <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yordanoff/" class="out-link">Joro</a> 
                    and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nequamx/" class="out-link">Vlady</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm passionate about my work and enjoy spending time in a code editor, to the 
                    point that I've made my website look like one. And yes, the text you're currently
                     reading has a line height of exactly 24 pixels. Although I have plenty of screen
                      time, I know that's not optimal long-term, which is why I'm also interested in 
                      mental and physical health, nutrition, and improving my routine. I believe that 
                      teamwork between people is just as important as teamwork between your very own 
                      mind and body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, I like unraveling problems and getting to the bottom of things, sometimes
                     to an annoying degree. I'm interested in anything from math, grammar, and Rubik's 
                     cubes to truly complex matters, such as vertical centering in CSS. I've also been bboying
                      for over 10 years and salsa dancing lately as well. If I could have one superpower, 
                      it would be to clone myself, so I could do more stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've gotten to where I am largely because of people on the internet who've 
                    shared their knowledge and experience. On this website, I want to share my 
                    own ideas, software development insights, random thoughts, and general life 
                    lessons I learn along the way. I believe that sharing this, as opposed to 
                    sharing drunk pictures with your friends, can actually make a worthwhile 
                    difference. So, Merry Christmas Eve, and if you're interested in what I have 
                    to say, you can increase my followers count on any of these data harvesting platforms:
